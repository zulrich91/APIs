# RESTful APIs
* **REST** stands for **Representational State Transfer**. 
* It's an architectural style introduced by [_Roy Fielding in 2000](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/fielding_dissertation.pdf)_.
* REST principles: 
  * __Uniform Interface__: Resources are only accessible as representations and the rules for processing that representation are described through self-descriptive messages.
  * __Stateless__: Every client request to the server is self-contained and subsequent requests do not require information from prior requests.
  * __Client-Server__: A client and server must be present in the architecture.
  * __Cacheable & Layered System__: Caching and other techniques are utilized in order to increase network efficiency.
